                Ecommerce Care International LLP was launched in 2020 by Mr.
                Pankaj Mutreja. Prior to this, in 2006, Mr. Pankaj founded
                Solution Forever, a sibling company to Ecommerce Care
                International LLP. Driven by an entrepreneurial spirit, Mr.
                Pankaj was determined to leverage his skills to make a positive
                impact on the world. His passion for engineering and designing
                devices led to a pivotal moment when he dedicated himself to
                helping a child stand and walk. Despite having no formal
                education in this field, Mr. Pankaj spent countless days and
                nights researching and developing equipment to assist the child.
                The success of this initiative gave him a profound sense of
                purpose, encapsulated in his reflection, "We helped him stand,
                and that's when we realized how helpful we might be in the
                market.‚Äù
